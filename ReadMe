​🛡️ PMFX V8H-CORE: The 5-Khunpon AI Ecosystem
​V8H-CORE is a professional-grade automated trading framework developed by PMFX TRADING COMPANY. This system integrates advanced quantitative analysis, institutional order flow tracking, and AI-driven sentiment processing to navigate the XAUUSD (Gold) market with high precision.
​🌌 Project Concept: The 5-Khunpon Synergy
​The system operates through the coordination of five specialized AI modules, designed to eliminate human bias and manage extreme market volatility. 
​V8H-CORE (The Engine): High-performance execution and signal generation.
​MZ-CORE (The Maestro): Dynamic market zoning and structural analysis. 
​DP-CORE (The Oracle): Dark Pool and institutional volume tracking. 
​TM-CORE (The Compass): Multi-timeframe trend and phase recognition. 
​SM-CORE (The Sentinel): Real-time sentiment analysis with Priced-in/Decay logic.
​🧠 Key Intelligence: Seven-Core Interface
​All modules are unified under the Seven-Core Interface, a sophisticated decision-making gateway that applies deep learning models (.h5) to evaluate trade clearance. 
​Adaptive Risk Management: Automatic volume scaling based on real-time equity growth (e.g., reducing exposure by 50-80% upon hitting profit targets). 
​Behavioral Logging: Systematic capture of over 1,200 data ticks per cycle for continuous AI training and reinforcement learning. 
​Sentiment Fatigue Logic: Advanced memory processing to filter out repetitive news impact and "fake news" spikes.
